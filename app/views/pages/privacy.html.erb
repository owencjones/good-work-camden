        Families with complex needs
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Camden Council is part of the Government's initiative for families with complex needs. This aims to support families struggling to cope who are facing multiple challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        The Council will be identifying those families with the most pressing and complex needs. This will involve some sharing of information between council departments and with other organisations. Any such sharing will be done proportionately and lawfully for the purpose of identifying those families who most need this support. 
        Sharing will be done to ensure that services are better coordinated and focused for those families.

        Camden Residents' Index (CRI)
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Camden Residents Index (CRI) is a system that pulls in resident information from a number of different council systems to display a single view of a citizen and their engagement with the council services. CRI also displays the household view, pivoted around the address. Only records that have been active within the last two years will be included. No data is actually held in CRI so any changes to the data (as well as retention policies) are applied within the source systems. 
        There is no third party access to CRI.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Systems that feed data into CRI include: Electoral Roll, Council Tax, Housing Benefits, Adult and Children's Social Care system, Pupil database (Schools Admissions, SEN and Inclusions system), Parking Permits, Accessible Transport (Freedom Passes), Libraries, Contact Camden, Housing, Youth Offending and Early Years system. The Connexions data is soon to be added.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Information provided to Camden Safety Net is not displayed in the CRI (although it is used for reporting purposes behind the scenes, eg. by the Resilient Families team).
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Data displayed in CRI includes basic demographic data (name, address, DOB, sex, marital status, ethnicity, contact details, source system reference numbers including NINO, NHS number, Unique Pupil number, and some flags (eg. disability, caution flag etc).
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        The information displayed in CRI is used for:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li>
        <label class="govuk-label">

        <li>

        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-label">
        Approximately 350 staff across the council have access to CRI. Their access is tailored on a need to know basis and the majority of the system users will only access the Adults' records. Access to children's records is restricted to children's services staff (the complex families teams, children missing education, safeguarding, admissions fraud etc), system administrators and audit teams. 
        Additionally the system has the ability to shield records such as records restricted in the source system, or staff or celebrity records

        Child protection information sharing project (CP-IS)
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        The child protection information sharing project is an NHS England national initiative that has been developed to improve the protection of children known to children's social work services.   
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        The project links the IT systems of NHS unscheduled care settings (hospital emergency departments, out of hours GPs, walk in centres, minor injuries units, paediatric wards, ambulance services and maternity units) to the IT systems used by children's social work so that information can be shared about children subject to a child protection plan; children in care (looked after) and pregnant women whose unborn child is subject to a pre-birth child protection plan.  
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Only basic details of the child will be shared including name, date of birth, address and whether they are looked after or subject to a child protection or pre-birth plan. No details of why the child is subject to a child protection plan or is looked after will be provided.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Medical staff will be able to access the system to check whether a child who is being treated at their setting is on the list. Social services will receive an electronic notification every time a child on the list has their name searched.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Medical staff will then contact social services to provide details of the reason for the child being seen and whether any concerns have been identified.  
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        CP-IS is a secure system and only authorised staff involved with the care of a child can access the information.  
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        The CP-IS system is governed by a national information sharing protocol which provides the necessary safeguards for the handling of personal sensitive information.

        The Rogue Landlord and Agent Checker
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Camden Council is part of the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Rogue Landlord and Agent Checker. All London councils have now agreed to participate in the Rogue Landlord and Agent Checker. It publicly displays information about private landlords and letting agents who have been prosecuted or fined by all London Boroughs and the London Fire Brigade.
        The Checker is a two-tier database hosted by the GLA. The first tier is for general public access and gives details of landlords and letting agents with unspent criminal convictions for housing-related offences under such legislation as: Housing Act 2004, Housing Act 1985, Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949, Environmental Protection Act 1990, Protection from Eviction Act 1977, Fraud Act 2006. 
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        The first tier includes information such as:
        </p>

        <label class="govuk-label">
        landlord/agent name,

        </label>
        </li>         
        </ul>


        <p class="govuk-label">
        The second tier is for selected staff in Private Sector Housing teams at all London local authorities, to view spent and unspent convictions, cautions, and civil penalty notices (up to six years old) in addition to the information in Tier 1.  
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        The Checker will support Camden housing officers, environmental health officers, fire brigade officers and trading standards officers in their enforcement efforts, through information sharing and increased awareness amongst renters, landlords and letting agents of the work that councils are doing locally to crack down on criminal behaviour. The processing is considered to be necessary in respect of the performance of our underlying statutory powers of enforcement and for reasons of substantial public interest.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        Information on the Checker will be shared from three London Borough of Camden departments (private sector housing, trading standards and housing options) with the other London Boroughs.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-label">
        The database is a secure system and only authorised senior staff can edit and add details on the database. Camden has an Information Sharing Procedure agreed with the GLA relating to the Rogue Landlord and Agent Checker.

        Equalities

        <p class="govuk-label">
        The Council is under legal duties to have regard to the impact of its policies and operation upon various groups based on factors such as age, sex, ethnic origin, race, sexual orientation. Gathering and analysing statistics on these factors allows the Council to ensure it implements and designs its policies in as fair a way as it can. It regularly prepares equality impact assessments on particular polices to ensure that those policies do not unfairly impact upon any groups and it also uses them to ensure that it complies with its duty to promote relations between different groups. Such statistical data does not allow for the individual identification of any specific person and it will not impact upon any individual's particular entitlement to services and or facilities.
